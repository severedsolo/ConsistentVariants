Consistent Variant Config Creator

Made to take some of the monotomy out of creating configs for CV, most data will be autofilled, you just need to decide on a theme for each part with Variants.

Instructions:
1) Install ConsistentVariants (and include all configs that ship with it)
2) Install the mod you want to generate configs for.
3) Load KSP and enter the Editor.
4) A file will be created in the ConsistentVariants folder called "GeneratedConfig.cfg" - in there are your generated config nodes.
5) Go through each part in the file and assign a theme. If you don't want that part to have a theme/if you want the part to be ignored by ConsistentVariants, put N/A.
6) Rename file and move it into your own mods directory.
